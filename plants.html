        <h3><b>Organic Farming </b>is the natural way of farming in which no chemicals are used either as fertilizers, or pesticides. Organic Farming is done using only natural manures like organic wastes, farm wastes, animal wastes, compost, etc. It basically
            aims at keeping the soil alive with maintaining the health of soil. Crop rotation, mixed cropping and biological pest control are some of the methods being followed in Organic Farming. Organic Farming emphasizes on using only biological materials
            and bio-fertilizers to provide nutrients for the growth of the crops and that too in pollution free and Eco-friendly environment. In India, Organic Farming is the ancient way of farming which is being followed since ages to gain sustainable
            crop production.</h3>
        <h3><b>1. Soil management After</b> cultivation of crops, the soil loses its nutrients and its quality deplete. Organic agriculture initiates the use of natural ways to increase the fertility of the soil. Hence, it focuses on the use of bacteria that
            is present in animal waste. The bacteria helps in making the soil nutrients more productive and fertile.</h3>
        <h3>
            <b>Weed management </b>Weed is the unwanted plant that grows in agricultural fields. Organic agriculture focuses on lowering weed and not removing it completely. The two most widely used weed management techniques areMulching: A process where
            we use plastic films or plant residue on the surface of the soil to block the growth of weed. ‚óè Mowing or Cutting: Where there is a removal of weeds top growth.</h3>
        <h3><b>3. Crop diversity</b> Monoculture is the practice used in the agricultural fields where we harvest and cultivate only one type of crop in a particular place. Recently, polyculture has come in existence, where we harvest and cultivate kinds
            of crops. To meet the increasing crop demand and produce the required soil microorganisms.</h3>
