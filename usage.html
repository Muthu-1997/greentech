    <h2>Animals in the Farm Ecosystem</h2>
    <P>
        Livestock animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and chickens, have many roles in the farm ecosystem. They eat corn and hay grown on the farm, they provide milk, eggs, wool and meat for humans, and their waste can fertilize the soil. Animal manure contains
        many nutrients that plants can use to grow. Some farmers collect the manure generated in their barns and spread it on their fields. Animal waste can also be a problem, however. Bacteria in manure can cause diseases. If livestock are near streams,
        their waste may enter the water that other animals (including humans) may want to drink. Wild animals are also part of the farm ecosystem. Deer and raccoons may eat a farmer's corn crop, while groundhogs can dig under their fields. Scarecrows
        are used to scare away wild birds from stealing grain out of farmers' fields, but they also scare away birds that might eat harmful insects. Skunks, toads, frogs also help the farmer by eating harmful insects. Farmers use fences to keep out unwanted
        animals.
