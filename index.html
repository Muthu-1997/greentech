            India has the 10th-largest arable land resources in the world. With 20 agri-climatic regions, all 15 major climates in the world exist in India. The country also possesses 46 of the 60 soil types in the world. India is the largest producer 
            of spices,pulses, milk, tea, cashew and jute; and the second largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane, cotton and oilseeds. Further, India is second in global production of fruits and vegetables, and is the largest
             produce of mango and banana. During 2017-18 crop year, food grain production is estimated at record 284.83 million tonnes. In 2018-19, Government of India is targeting foodgrain production of 285.2 million tonnes. Production of horticulture crops
            is estimated at 306.82million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18 as per third advance estimates. India is among the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products in the world. Agricultural exports from India reached US$ 38.21 billion in FY18 and US$ 38.54
            billion in FY19. Exports of ready to eat items from India reached US$ 689.80 million in FY18 and have reached US$ 681.95 million in FY19. The Agriculture Export Policy, 2018 was approved by Government of India in December 2018. The new policy
            aims to increase India’s agricultural exports to US$ 60 billion by 2022. India was the ninth largest exporter of agricultural products in 2017.

            the most important sector of Indian Economy. Indian agriculture sector accounts for 18 per cent of India's gross domestic product (GDP) and provides employment to 50% of the countries workforce. India is the world’s largest producer of pulses, 
            rice, wheat,spices and spice products. India has many areas to choose for business such as dairy, meat, poultry, fisheries and food grains etc. India has emerged as the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world [1]. According
             to the data provided by Department of Economics and Statics (DES) the production of food grains for the year 2013-2014 is 264 million tons which is increased when compared to (2012-2013) 257million tons. This is a good symptom for the Indian economy
            from the agriculture sector. India remains among main three as far as production of different agricultural things like paddy, wheat, pulses, groundnut, rapeseeds, natural products, vegetables, sugarcane, tea, jute, cotton, tobacco leaves and
            so on. On the other hand, on advertising front, Indian agribusiness is as yet confronting the issues, for example, low level of business sector reconciliation and integration, availability of dependable and convenient information needed by
            farmers on different issues in farming </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 ">
            Export of spices from India are relied upon to reach US$ 3 billion by 2016-17, on the back of imaginative promoting strategies, inventive bundling, quality in quality and an in number appropriation system. The Indian flavors business is pegged 
            at Rs 40,000 crore (US$ 6.42 billion) every year, of which the marked portion represents 15% [3]. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) was launched from Rabi, 2007-08. The fundamental targets of the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) is 
            to expand production of rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals through region extension and efficiency upgrade in a supportable way in the recognized locale of the nation; restoring soil ripeness and profitability at the individual ranch level; and
            improving farm level economy (i.e. ranch benefits) to restore confidence amongst the farmers. The Mission met with a staggering achievement and accomplished the focused on extra generation of rice, wheat and heartbeats. The Mission is being
            kept amid Twelfth Five Year Plan with new focuses of extra generation of sustenance grains of 25 million tons including 10 million tons of rice, 8 million tons of wheat, 4 million tons of pulses and 3 million tons of coarse cereals by the
            end of twelfth five year plan.

                            <p>Horticulture has been defined as the culture of plants, mainly for food, materials, comfort and beauty.[1] According to an American horticulture scholar, "Horticulture is the growing of flowers, fruits and vegetables, and of
                                plants for ornament and fancy."[2] A more precise definition can be given as "The cultivation, processing, and sale of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and ornamental plants as well as many additional services".[3] It also includes
                                plant conservation, landscape restoration, soil management, landscape and garden design, construction and maintenance, and arboriculture. In contrast to agriculture, horticulture does not include large-scale crop production
                                or animal husbandry. Horticulturists apply knowledge, skills, and technologies to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs. Their work involves plant propagation
                                and cultivation with the aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, and technical
                                advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture.</p>

                <p>India occupies more than 17% of the population of World with only 2.4% land share. India is famous for agricultural farming. At the global level, it appears that we are slowly moving towards the global food crisis. Recently published report
                    of UN on the ‘Right to Food’ estimated that nearly one billion people sleep without food across the world and in every six seconds a child dies of malnutrition. Agricultural production is an important contributor to India economy and
                    provides nearly 67% of the country‘s employment. Over the past few years, horticulture has made remarkable progress in terms of expansion in area and production under different crops, increase in productivity, crop diversification,
                    technological interventions for production and post-harvest and forward linkages through value addition and marketing. Despite several challenges and opportunities namely tumultuous weather, seasonal cyclones, occasional drought, demographic
                    pressure, industrialization, urbanization and unprecedented use of insecticide & pesticide and compulsion for migration of rural masses to urban areas, especially for their livelihood. Production of horticulture crops like vegetables
                    and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years’ average, while, foodgrain output is 277.49 million tonnes, exceeding
                    the previous record of 275.11 million tonnes during 2016-17.</p>

        <h5>Water scarcity</h5>
        <p class="globle">
            <h4> Water scarcity has a huge impact on food production. Without water people do not have a means of watering their crops and, therefore, to provide food for the fast growing population. According to the International Water Management Institute
                , agriculture, which accounts for about 70% of global water withdrawals, is constantly competing with domestic, industrial and environmental uses for a scarce water supply. In attempts to fix this ever growing problem, many have tried
                to form more effective methods of water management.One such method is irrigation management. Irrigation is a method of transporting water to crops in order to maximize the amount of crops produced. Many of the irrigation systems in place
                do not use the water in the most efficient way. This causes more water then necessary to be used or for there not to be enough water to ensure healthy crops. According to the<b><font color="black"> Bank, irrigation management works to upgrade and maintain irrigation systems,
                According to the book,Rainfed Agriculture: Unlocking the Potential, 80% of the land farmed around the world is rainfed and it "contributes about 58% to the global food basket"</font></b>. Some techniques in water management for rainfed
                agriculture include the use of supplemental irrigation and water harvesting techniques, such as rain catchment systems and weirs or sand dams. These techniques help provide much needed water to areas where rainfall is inconsistent. Having
                this water helps to increase the number and quality of the crops grown. such as groundwater irrigation, that are already in place and expands the areas of irrigation to increase the amount of crops being produced.

            <div class="container-fluid">
                <h5>Water Scarcity In Agriculture: Predicting, Preventing And Protecting</h5>
                <b>(1) Efficient water management:</b> We need to reduce the dependency on monsoon by replacing surface and flood irrigation etc. by Micro, sub-surface or sprinkler irrigation. Mulching should be promoted to reduce evaporation losses.
                Farmers tend to give excess irrigation whenever he has surplus water, many times at the cost of another farmer e.g. people at the tail-end of a canal. Farmers must be educated about negative effects of excess irrigation. Farm ponds should
                be made mandatory, especially in drought prone areas. Canals’ lining should be mandatory to avoid water loss through seepage. Small check-dams and water-retention ponds on government lands, based on topological survey, should be constructed
                all over India. If better roads are the reflections of a developed country, better canals are the reflections of a solid agricultural economy. It will be great if we construct one km of well-lined canals for every km of road constructed.
                <br>
                <b>(2) Climate-resilient varieties:</b>Better cultivars will always be critical to agricultural adaptation. For example, now climate-resilient rice varieties are being promoted and disseminated by the Stress-tolerant Rice for Africa and
                South Asia (STRASA) project in India. According to Seednet, rice varieties released by STRASA captured 27% of the total order for 2017 kharif season. Both flood and drought-tolerant varieties like Swarna-Sub1, Samba- Sub1, Sahbhagi dhan
                and DRR42, are in top 10. KisanKraft is developing and promoting Aerobic Rice – which reduces water consumption by over 50%, reduces GHG emissions, and has same yields.
                <br>
                <b>(3) Package of practices:</b>Educating farmers to adapt recommended package of practices alone would increase the farm productivity and income. Practices like summer ploughing, crop rotation, green manuring, fine tillage, proper spacing,
                timely inter-cultivation, weeding, fertilizer, pesticide application and harvesting should be done by adapting current scientific methods. For example, India utilizes around 170 kg of fertilizer per hectare of arable land, where as USA
                consumes only 130 kg per hectare, but has better productivity. While applying the fertilizer or pesticide “which form, when, and how” are also equally important along with “how much”. Application of recommended quantity of compost is also
                another practice that must be re-adapted by farmers. In case of rice, a crop that covers 28% of the irrigated land, some of the special practices like AWD and SRI can be adapted to save water and increase yield.
                <br>
                <b>Farming by businesses: </b>Currently businesses in India are not allowed commercial cultivation of non-plantation crops. Farmers have much lower risk-taking capacity and they will be more inclined to change their practices by observing
                successes of another system in their neighborhood. Government cannot have enough model farms. Allowing businesses to cultivate will bring advanced scientific practices to villages.

            <h3> Harvesting</h3>
            Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most labor-intensive
            activity of the growing season.These activities include loosening the soil, seeding, special watering, moving plants when they grow bigger, and harvesting, among others. The main steps for agricultural practices include preparation of soil,
            sowing, adding manure and fertilizers, irrigation, harvesting and storag.<br>
            <h3>Haversting process</h3>
            Harvesting rice consists of the basic operations which can be done in individual steps or in combination using a combine harvester. These include: Reaping - cutting the mature panicles and straw above ground. Threshing - separating the paddy grain from
            the rest of cut crop

                <h4> Smart Farming is key for the future of agriculture. Smart Farming is a farming management concept using modern technology to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural products. Farmers in the 21st century have access to GPS, soil
                    scanning, data management, and Internet of Things technologies. Farmers globally must increase food production 70 percent compared to 2007 levels to meet the needs of the larger population, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization of the United Nations. Also driving food demand is an increase in global income levels, especially those in developing countries Improve farming practices, rural infrastructure, and access to resources for food production
                    to increase the productivity of agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, raise smallholder incomes, reduce environmental impacts, promote rural prosperity, and ensure resilience to climate change.</h4>
